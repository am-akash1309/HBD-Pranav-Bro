    <h1>Happy Birthday, Brooo</h1>
    <p>Some people walk into your life and quietly leave something beautiful behind. A sense of peace, a steady presence, and a reminder that strength isn't always loud. You are that person.</p>
    
    <p>I've never known someone who could make silence feel safe, sarcasm feel warm, and reality feel just a little less heavy. You make people better, even if you don't always notice it.</p>

    <p>You've managed to become more than a friend, a constant, a calm in chaos, a home in the form of a person. You're the type of person who listens without judgment, speaks with clarity, and cares with intention. That's rare.</p>

    <p>Whether we're ranting about life, getting lost in Genshin maps, or just texting about absolutely nothing, every moment has mattered. And it still does. Your presence, your wisdom, and your ability to handle things with that quiet maturity, they inspire more than you realize.</p>

    <p>Today isn't just a birthday. It's a celebration of how much light you bring, just by being exactly who you are.</p>
    
    <p>Today isn't just about you turning a year older. It's about all the people who are better off because they've met you. People like me. Like us. </p>

    <p>So here's to you. The one who jokes like a brother, thinks like a philosopher, and guides like a father (even if we're chaos and you're forced into the role).</p>

    <p>May this year bring you everything you deserve. Joy without reason, peace that stays, and dreams that gently come true, one by one.</p>

    <p class="signature">From the sons you never asked for,<br>but somehow got stuck with anyway.</p>

    <p class="signature">- Happy Birthday, Bro</p>
